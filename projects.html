                Master Thesis (WIP):

           <p class="Project-content-text">
            The title of the master's thesis is 
            "Physics-based Simulation of Autonomous Bubble Detection Based on Visual and Acoustic Sensing", it is written at the <a href="https://www.marum.de/index.html" target="_blank">MARUM</a>. 
            The thesis involves the development of a simulation of an underwater environment in Unreal Engine 5.3. 
            The simulation encompasses the simulation of sensors such as a sonar and a camera, as well as an underwater environment with methane leaks. 
            Additionally, a system for autonomous bubble detection is developed. The system utilises two U-Net models to segment sonar and camera images provided by the simulation.

                works towards creating a simulation of an underwater exploration of an icy moon in a virtual environment. 
                This project takes place in the context of the TRIPLE project, which plans such missions in the future. 
                A focus of this project is simulating the navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in Unreal Engine 5.2. 
                For this purpose, the simulation contains many sensors that are commonly used for navigation.

                     It uses 3D printed objects with RFID chips and an RFID scanner, based on the chosen object the system changes music and lighting.

                        The subject of this bachelor's thesis is the development of an android application for text-to-speech (TTS). The app is designed to assist users in creating their own dataset.
                        It is able to record files via the user's smartphone and upload their own texts or books, which the user can then read aloud.
                        The app also features a server backend that hosts a Tacotron model, which can be trained with the user's dataset. The trained model can then be used as a TTS.

                                Data Science Master Course project. A segmentation model was used for the purpose of detecting the dessication of lakes or coastal erosion. The model in question is known as the DeepLabV3+ model. 
                                The objective of the study was to detect water on RGB satellite images. The detection was then used to create a history of the amount of coastal erosion or dessication.
